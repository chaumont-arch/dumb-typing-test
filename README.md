# dumb-typing-test
This is just a typing test I'm writing for personal use in python. I'm using github just for version control because idk what else I'd use. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

TODO:
You should have a dependency thing, since you're using that python wikipedia API. I don't know how to do that just yet, but I'll get on it sometime.
